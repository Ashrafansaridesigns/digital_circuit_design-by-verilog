Digital Circuit Design using Verilog
This repository contains a collection of digital circuit designs implemented in Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language). It demonstrates a variety of fundamental and advanced digital design concepts, ranging from basic gates to complex modules like arithmetic circuits, multiplexers, and sequential circuits.

Features
Clean Verilog Code: Well-structured and modularized designs for easy understanding.
Testbenches: Accompanied by testbenches to simulate and verify functionality.
Parameterized Modules: For scalability and reuse.
Simulation Results: Screenshots or waveform results included for verification.

Overview
Digital circuit design forms the foundation of modern electronics. Verilog HDL is a widely-used language for modeling and simulating digital circuits. This repository includes:

Basic combinational circuits like adders, multiplexers, and decoders.
Sequential circuits such as flip-flops, counters, and shift registers.
Arithmetic circuits (e.g., multipliers, subtractors).
Custom circuits designed for specific purposes.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To work with these Verilog designs, you will need:

A Verilog simulator like ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, or Cadence NCVerilog.
Basic knowledge of digital logic design and Verilog HDL.
